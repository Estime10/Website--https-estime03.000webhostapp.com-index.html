                    Being the last child of a soccer family it wasn't easy to tell my father 
                    That I wanted to play a different sport. 
                    Basketball, I said it now it is too late to walk backward.
                    Pops wasn’t really happy about it but he told me one thing:
                    “Son, if you go down that road you gonna have to be serious about it
                    I want you to put in the work and the effort to make the difference is 
                    This sport.”<br>

                        My father gives me the good  news.
                        Pepinster. 
                        I just got an offer from Pepinster, and he adds up that
                        It is a First division team which means that I will compete 
                        Against «  La crème de la crème » from Belgium.

                        The last season was strewn with pitfalls… new coach, new staff
                        So I took the decision to go somewhere else. I didn’t where I was 
                        Going to end up playing but there was one thing a was certain about
                        I am going to be the best version of myself.

                        After spending about 12 years travelling for basketball
                        It is time for me to come-back where I first started playing 
                        In 12 years I played everywhere here in Belgium but also abroad
                        So coming back home is the perfect move.
                        Signing with the most legendary team of Brussels seems to be the perfect
                        Fit to me. Represent for the Capital is such an honor to me.

                        But… There was something missing and my wife would come 
                        With that missing piece…<br>
                        I would soon find out that I was going to be a father.
                        When she made the announcement I was fulfilling with joy 
                        Then in a split second the fear started to take over.
                        The fear of not being able to be a good father, the fear of not
                        Being able to provide for my family  but the warrior in my was ready

                            I got to know my baby’s gender.
                            We did it the good way 
                            The entire family and friends was around us to celebrate.
                            A balloon away from knowing the gender… The pressure 
                            Was huge… As most of the male I wanted A little boy .
                            Guess what? SHE is going to be a daddy’s girl.
